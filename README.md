# Honesty by Convenience: Additional Data Wrangling and Analysis Scripts

This is the README file for the repository with the additional R scripts to produce the databases needed to replicate the paper. While the `hbc-ctol`already have manipulated dataframes, this script shows all of the code required to produce those databases on your own, if you were to download them from [the LAPOP AmericasBarometer website](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/free-access.php). 

You must use a fork of the `margins` package for this to work, as for some reason there seems to be some kind of mistake in the coding of the `margins` package for survey-weighted generalized linear models. I've explained this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69051248/15555143).

The RMarkdown notebook does not compile as a pdf, you must simply preview it so that the url generates. This is because it uses elements from the global environment- you must run the main script if you want it to work.

To be honest, this project wasn't thought to be as reproducible as the other repository, so once again I'm open to any comments and questions in my email, dsanchezp998@gmail.com. 

Again, this is in honor of my grandpa. Descansa en paz abuelito.

Regards,

Daniel
